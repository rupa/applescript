some utilities written in applescript

ffctl   - toggle firefox window sort of quake-like. meant to be bound toa global key combo
newterm - open a new terminal window. meant to be bound to a global key combo
qstile  - rudimentary window position/sizing. This is a quicksilver Action.
qtrm    - quake terminal. requires some setup, but I prefer it to Visor.
